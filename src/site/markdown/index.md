# Test suite: ets-cdb10

## Scope

This executable test suite (ETS) verifies the conformance of a CDB database (the
IUT) with respect to the [OGC CDB 1.0 specification][CDB-10]. The test suite
currently validates the metadata, directory structure, and file naming against
the specification and will report on any exceptions to the specification.

The test suite has partial support for OGC CDB 1.1; some tests will correctly
pass, and other will fail as they have not been updated to handle the changes in
OGC CDB 1.1. The current goal is to maximize support for version 1.0 and add
support for version 1.1 as edge cases are discovered.

Figure source: *OGC CDB 1.0 Volume 11: OGC CDB Core Standard Conceptual Model*

Several conformance classes are defined in the CDB 1.0 specification; the ones
listed below are covered by this test suite:

* CDB Structure
    - `/conf/core/file-structure`
    - `/conf/core/gtmodel-naming`
    - `/conf/core/mmodel-naming`
    - `/conf/core/tiled-data`
    - `/conf/core/navdata-naming`
    - `/conf/core/nav-data`
    - `/conf/core/tiled-raster-datasets-general`
    - `/conf/core/tiled-raster-elevation-terrain`
    - `/conf/core/tiled-terrain-bathymetry`
* Metadata and Versioning
    - `/conf/core/metadata-version`
    - `/conf/core/metadata-datasets`

## Test requirements

The documents listed below stipulate requirements that must be satisfied by a
conforming implementation.

1. [OGC CDB Core Standard: Model and Physical Data Store Structure 1.0](https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=72712)

Tests for various dataset naming and directory placements will be skipped if the
CDB (IUT) does not contain that dataset.

## Implemented Tests in the Test suite: ets-cdb10

Several conformance classes and tests are defined in the CDB 1.0 specification; [this document](./implemented_requirements.html) list the implemented ones. 



## Test suite structure

The test suite definition file (testng.xml) is located in the root package,
`org.opengis.cite.cdb10`. A conformance class corresponds to a &lt;test&gt; element, each
of which includes a set of test classes that contain the actual test methods.
The general structure of the test suite is shown in Table 1.

<table>
  <caption>Table 1 - Test suite structure</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: left; background-color: LightCyan">
      <th>Conformance class</th>
      <th>Test classes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>CDB Structure</td>
      <td>org.opengis.cite.cdb10.cdbStructure.*</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Metadata And Versioning</td>
      <td>org.opengis.cite.cdb10.metadataAndVersioning.*</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The Javadoc documentation provides more detailed information about the test
methods that constitute the suite.


## Test run arguments

The test run arguments are summarized in Table 2. The _Obligation_ descriptor can
have the following values: M (mandatory), O (optional), or C (conditional).

<table>
	<caption>Table 2 - Test run arguments</caption>
	<thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Value domain</th>
	    <th>Obligation</th>
	    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
	<tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>iut</td>
      <td>URI</td>
      <td>M</td>
      <td>A URI that refers to the implementation under test or metadata about it.
    Ampersand ('&amp;') characters must be percent-encoded as '%26'. This URI should
    refer to a CDB on the file system that is accessible by this test suite tool, and
    not refer to a web URI. This also applies when running under TEAM Engine.</td>
    </tr>
	  <tr>
      <td>ics</td>
      <td>A comma-separated list of string values.</td>
      <td>O</td>
      <td>An implementation conformance statement that indicates which conformance
      classes or options are supported. E.g. "1,2" would run both "CDB Structure"
      tests and "Metadata and Versioning" tests.</td>
    </tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

## Test Suite Self-Test

This test suite contains a self-test that will generate scenarios to ensure that
the CITE test suite will properly catch problems in a CDB. This self-test is
organized under the `src/test/java/org.opengis.cite.cdb10` package and runs using
JUnit.

Please see the "How To" guides for instructions on running this self-test suite
in various environments.

## JDK Support

This test suite was developed to run on Oracle JDK 8. It has been tested to also
run under OpenJDK 8.

The following JDKs have been tested to run the self-test suite, but have not
been checked to run the CITE suite against a CDB.

* Oracle JDK 9
* OpenJDK 10
* OpenJDK 11
* OpenJDK 12

Please note that [some of these JDKs no longer are supported][JDK-support] and
that this test suite will be moving to support the JDKs that are still supported by Oracle.
